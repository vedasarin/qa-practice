# QA Practice Portfolio

This repository demonstrates my end-to-end QA workflows, including manual test cases, API testing with Postman, SQL validations, and structured bug reporting. It showcases how I design, execute, and document complete testing cycles.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **TestCases/**  
  Manual test cases written step by step for each API (Login, Registration).

- **Postman/**  
  Postman collections and requests for API execution.

- **SQL/**  
  SQL scripts to validate backend data after API execution.

- **BugReports/**  
  Defects identified during testing, documented in Markdown format. Includes a reusable bug report template.

## 🚀 Completed QA Cycles

### 1. Login API
- Manual test case → `TestCases/login_testcase.txt`  
- Postman request → `Postman/login_collection.json`  
- SQL validation → `SQL/login_verification.txt`  
- Bug reports → none logged

### 2. Registration API
- Manual test case → `TestCases/registration_testcase.txt`  
- Postman request → `Postman/registration_collection.json`  
- SQL validation → `SQL/registration_verification.txt`  
- Bug reports →  
  - `BugReports/registration_missing_fields.md`  
  - `BugReports/registration_duplicate_email.md`

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. **Manual Test Cases**  
   Review `.txt` files in `TestCases/` for step-by-step execution flow.

2. **Postman Execution**  
   - Import JSON collections from `Postman/` into Postman.  
   - Run requests and observe responses.

3. **SQL Validation**  
   - Execute queries from `SQL/` against the database.  
   - Confirm data consistency after API calls.

4. **Bug Reports**  
   - Check `BugReports/` for defects found during testing.  
   - Each report includes steps, expected vs actual results, and impact.
