# QA Practice Repository

This repository contains artifacts for manual testing practice:

* **testcases.txt** → Core test cases
* **testcases2.txt** → Bug validation scenarios
* **queries.sql** → SQL queries for DB validation
* **postman\_collection.json** → API test collection
* **testplan.md** → Test plan documentation

Bugs are tracked via GitHub Issues and linked to commits.



\## 🧪 API Testing with Postman



This repository includes Postman collections used for API validation and practice. The setup was initialized using Postman's local Git integration, which created two folders:



\- `.postman/` — contains internal Postman configuration files (e.g., workspace settings, globals)

\- `postman/` — contains actual API collections used for testing



\### 📁 Collection Files

All API test collections are stored in:
Postman/postman/collections/


Included files:
- `my_collection.json`
- `practice_collection.json`

These collections align with manual test cases, SQL validations, and bug tracking workflows to support full-stack QA coverage.
